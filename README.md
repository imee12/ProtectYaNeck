Wu Tang Killa Bees on the Storm
=====================

JavaScript Technical questions brought to you from the slums of Shaolin.

## Using Protect Ya Neck

It's in early infancy, son. Questions are all hard-coded. Will move question database to something worthy: Couch/PouchDB? Firebase? MongoDB?  Long answer: I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses. Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries. Short answer: I haven't decided yet.

## Issues

I can't spend too much time right now making this worthy of WuGambino material with a scalable and easy to access db, but once I pass these technical interviews, this will be ready for the Ruckus.

Wu Tang Forever. 

AND REMEMBER WU IS FOR THE CHILDREN.
